    description: Auttaja is a moderation bot for the Discord messaging platform. I have been a member of the Auttaja development team since the 29th January 2018.

  MagicCap:

    url: https://magiccap.me
    description: MagicCap is a image/GIF/clipboard capture and file upload suite for macOS and Linux. MagicCap was created by me in mid 2018 due to the lack of good capture software on both platforms (whereas Windows has ShareX). During my time owning MagicCap, I have reviewed a lot of large changes, set up a CI so that the application can easily be built, and became extremely proficient in the Electron framework.
  # Information about MagicCap/my role with making it.

  ParseThoseArgs:
    description: ParseThoseArgs is a argument parser written in C/Python. It is intended to be an extremely fast argument parser for Python. Even though it is not a large project, it helps to accelerate Python chatbots due to the interpreted nature of Python.
