To whom this may concern,

My name is Astrid Gealer, I live in Brighton, and am a patient at WellBN. I have personally been seen by Dr Sam Hall (who you forced out), and I want to give you an idea of the sort of person you have lost in the NHS, discuss your actions to the healthcare of minors, and how it will affect everyone who is transgender within Brighton.

I moved from Portsmouth after studying in Newcastle. I knew I am transgender many years ago, but my Portsmouth GP was useless. He didn't even put it on my record, so I didn't get a Travistock referral. After I moved to Brighton, I was in a rough place. I knew I needed healthcare, I had undiagnosed POTS because nobody else within the NHS was unable to do their jobs properly, and I was unsure how to do DIY hormones (I know now, will get onto that one later). After a in depth consultation with WellBN I was able to get the healthcare I need from Sam Hall. This was genuinely life changing to be able to get the hormones I need. 

After this though, I started to slip mentally again. Not because of the hormones, but rather the toxic climate of the UK. I started to feel like an outsider in this country I was born in. Like I was subhuman. On top of this, your Sussex GIC pilot was ran like a genuinely evil A/B test. In the A group is people that were referred to Travistock earlier than a certain date, the B group is people that weren't. I was a month late to this referral due to the actions of my prior GP, so I was in B group. A group got the healthcare they need, B group was condemned to death by the NHS by making sure we felt like we'd never get the healthcare we desperately need. This took a major toll on me, and I almost am not here to tell the tale. Luckily, someone was there for me: Dr Sam Hall. He helped me get my POTS diagnosed, get my ADHD diagnosed, get my depression taken care of, and handle the many external factors in my life. I was probably a dreadful patient, but I'm eternally grateful to him. He put so much energy into making sure I can send this today.

With children in WellBN, you have both put them in B group and also kicked out the one deeply caring, loving, deeply understanding individual that could make sure they have a fighting chance. I am sure many will make it through, but I have deep concern for many others. The NHS has lost more than you will ever know and likely has blood on its hands. Instead of extending the Sussex GIC pilot to make it not an evil A/B, you instead go after the person trying to make the system better. It's unspeakably cruel, and per your own report, you know this will likely lead to death.

I am in a better place mentally now thanks to WellBN and not dead, and if you ever stop my prescription, I can use the Internet. You block my ability on the clearnet to get the medication I need, I know how to use Tor. You won't stop me and those around me getting the healthcare they 
need. I'm an adult, you won't stop me.

I remember when the NHS was about saving lives, now its seemingly about killing people if its the politically sound thing to do. I know you probably won't care about my thoughts, but do better. I am happy to be contacted about this on this email or [phone number redacted].
