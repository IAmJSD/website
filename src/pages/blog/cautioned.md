title: I accepted a police caution
description: "My Police caution is a danger sign to a police force without political interference and to how the police treats the law."
---

You may have seen [my last blog post about my legal issues.](/met-police) I yesterday accepted a caution, and I thought I'd walk you through the chain of events that caused this. This isn't a decision I took lightly, but the mental pain that the Metropolitan Police put me under cannot be understated for the crime of downloading and committing to a repository nobody saw a CSV file that was publicly reported on and public interest.

I now have all my drives back, which were seized for the crime of committing a CSV file to Git:

For the record, I have reported many people over the years for everything from being very abusive literally in front of a cop, threatening my life, to punching me in the face. None of these were dealt with properly. I don't have all the facts yet, but something is off here, and I'm going to dig deeper. This is unprecedented for the Met police.

This means in the UK that I was never convicted of a crime or arrested, however I do technically now have a criminal record. It will be immediately "spent" (the name of a conviction in the UK which hides from basic criminal record checks), and I can get it removed from even enhanced UK criminal record checks in 6 years, but it is very annoying that in the future I have to go through more of a process (but less than some other people since its a caution for a crime that is not of moral turpitude) to get visas.

## The interview

I ended off the last blog post by saying I was having an interview. I thought this alone was really stupid; and still believe such. What I wasn't prepared for was how demoralising the interview was going to be.

I turn up to Brighton police station. I did notice they removed all the pride flags, which is just as well, there's no pride in anything happening here. I was outside the station taking a picture so people knew I was okay when the detective walked over. To be fair, the detective in question was nothing but nice to me. After all, without defending a detective who is deadset on changing my life too hard, I think this guy isn't the ringleader.

There was multiple times when "he" was used to describe me. I'm clearly not a guy. Multiple people walked into the room, the social worker and the lawyer on my side, both extremely close to the Police it seems.

After telling my lawyer everything, he went ahead and told me that the defence I should use is that nobody saw it, but I shouldn't no comment at all. I think the public interest defence was better, but I took his word. Honestly, I think that nobody really understood technology in that room apart from the other officer with the detective. I was put in a pretty bad situation here because it felt like I didn't get the advise I needed. I was never told about any search warrant. This is relevant because I am mid-move, so half my seized devices were at my old flat.

I was read my UK version of the miranda rights which is something like this:

> You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

You will notice this is HEAVILY different to the US one. I hate to say this, but America is right here and we are wrong to levels that allow innocent people to face the wrath of the legal system. In America, its very common to shut up during an interview. In England, this will harm your defence. This did mean my lawyer was probably right about not being silent, but also creates major problems because you may accidentally fall into issues when you are under the severe pressure of a Police interrogation.

This needs to change. The right to silence is a cornerstone of a justice system. We are failing people as a country.

## You did what?!?!?!

Most of the interview on my end felt relatively smooth. I was asked if I hacked the Free Speech Union because apparently they still thought this might be the case, but I didn't, so I answered no. However, a couple minutes before the interview was about to conclude, I was told "you will know we executed a search warrant at your address". I didn't know, I felt genuinely ill. It's not that I have much to hide on my storage from the Police, but I really value my privacy. I have a PTSD trigger from when I was in university about the security illegally searching my room, its probably the worst thing you can ever do to me as a human being. My lawyer not telling me this beforehand and allowing me to walk into that room unaware made the moment far more destabilising than it needed to be.

This prosecution is far from normal. At the very worst, I should have expected a few hundred pound fine from the ICO at worst. I was not the hacker and they are the ones who generally have the remit to handle this. At the beginning of the interview, the detective didn't seem to know the law he was really enforcing.

I suspect this entire thing was politically motivated. I am unsure what caused this, but my speculation is I think it was something said by the FSU to the Met or maybe the Met have this internally of one of the following:

- The Met are fond of the Free Speech Union (possible, but I don't think likely as the sole reason).
- The saw me push the data and that I am transgender and used that as the reason. I do happen to think this is the reason considering the parties involved.
- They saw that I am running for selections to be a Green Party councillor. I also think this is very likely, and the timings do match up here for this to possibly be the case. I put my name forward publicly for councillor selections on the 24th January, and on the 30th my flat was raided.

Nonetheless, I think this was vastly disproportionate. This had a severe impact on my mental health, and frankly, I think the Met themselves were worried since they made me call a friend and the social worker dropped me off near their house (which was nice of them, although in the car they were trying to make me feel guilty about who I am by telling me all about how parents find it hard when a child is transgender).

## Get my devices back or take it to trial

I felt like I had a gun to my head on this on this one. I am very lucky I was mid-move so they didn't seize my laptop and phone. If they did that, I would've had no income and they would've destroyed my life. I at least had those on me, but most of my stuff was taken from me, and it could've been over a year before I got everything back. The gun was disproportionately taking my stuff and keeping it to make my life hell. If I want it back, I can just sign the caution!

Unfortunately, in the UK, even pre the scrapping of jury trials for most cases, most cases in this country do not get a jury trial. If the crime you are accused of has under a maximum of a 6 month prison term or £5,000 fine, you don't get a jury. You will get a judge. I am fairly certain I could convince a jury that I am innocent because this is public interest, but not a judge. Public interest is so subjective, and an elite deciding my fate is something I would not plead not guilty for, especially with how the CPS has treated transgender people recently.

I do fully plan to request removal of the caution though. Several procedural errors, disproportionate searches, and bad counsel are my primary reasons, along with some exceptional circumstances.

I am furious. The UK is not a safe place for transgender people or indie hackers. This was a data analysis project for me, and when AI does that its fine, but when a human does it is not. I wonder if the party that stored the data insecurely will face criminal prosecutions?
