In this blog post, I will refer to X as Twitter, but not xAI. Sorry if this annoys you.

Due to Grok's recent actions, it has came out that [Ofcom may use their banning powers on Twitter](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgjzknepvzo). This on the surface seems like a good idea, but I think we may skip many other good options to go to the one that is potentially harmful for a free and open internet.

## Grok's abusive crusade

Fairly recently, xAI added to Grok a "spicy mode". This basically allows you to edit a image with nudity. This includes non-consenting women and children, causing CSAM to be made with Grok. I am obviously not going to share examples here because I didn't capture them myself, but you'll just have to trust me that I saw several posts up for a few days.

Since Grok can be used in the replies of Twitter posts, this was mainly used to target women by replying to posts from women people disagree with and getting Grok to undress them. We are not sex objects. This tool creates a very real risk of people being abused by sexual predators.

This sort of sexualisation is not funny. It is the sort of thing that makes me feel less safe walking down the street. The idea that people could use AI to create sexual images of me is vomit inducing. The idea that people can do this with children is even more so. Yet, Elon was using this platform to brag about this functionality. It's amazing that many of the people finding this funny are the same people saying that transgender women shouldn't use female toilets. Really makes you think who might be the sex pests!

I've heard many people compare this to Photoshop, with Elon retweeting a tweet asking "who cares" if Grok can do that because Photoshop does. I do.

For someone who was saying he's scared about AI safety, Elon has definitely changed his tune (probably because he wanted to fight OpenAI). The barrier of entry for manipulating a image into CSAM or non-consensual nudity is lower, and the founder is bragging about how it can be put people into bikinis. Have you ever heard the CEO do that?

And besides, the problem isn't that you can do that, its that it will do that for you. If you open Photoshop and want to do this, you will have to learn a lot of tooling and it involves manual labour. It is possible to get somewhat realistic editing results, yes, but its not a 30 second thing like Grok is.

Obviously, once UK authorities got wind of this because of the press and people tipping Ofcom, there was an investigation. Many of us initially thought this would go nowhere, but when the government stepped in (they never do, but this is so sickening that it was clear they had to), blocking came on the table.

At which point, xAI's handling of this would be comical if it wasn't so fucked up; they made it a PAID FEATURE! So now you can pay Twitter money to have a bot that will generate non-consensual sexual images of women and children. What the actual fuck?!? This doesn't fix the problem, this just makes it a paid feature.

At which point, the government said what most people in the country are thinking which is "this is a insult". This seems to have pushed the blocking argument to be more likely. Elon then turned this into a free speech argument.

## The free and open internet

I shed no tears for Twitter. Twitter dug their own hole by dealing with non-consensual image generation as if it was joke, with complete disrespect for the women that use their platform. It was a abhorrent reaction.

The natural reaction to this is a deep packet inspection and DNS block x.com. This makes sense if you aren't used to how the internet functions, nobody wants a internet with this content on it. However, I propose we should scrap all laws allowing for deep packet inspection and DNS blocks. Obviously not because of this, this is a hardline view I have had for over a decade.

Is it being used for a bad company now? Sure, but having the infrastructure in place to do these blocks is a gift for Reform. If they get into power, they will happily use the same infrastructure to censor LGBT websites or anything else they deem "woke". Creating and using the infrastructure to block The Pirate Bay was already a bad starting pistol, blocking Twitter will incentivise future governments that using blocks is okay. This is terrifying.

Additionally, the amount of collateral risk of doing a block this way is super risky and does scare me a lot. The amount of services that depend on their API's will cause problems within the country. Additionally, if they resort to IP blocks like some countries, they may pull down large amounts of web infrastructure.

I think to maintain the free and open internet, the best solution is to totally prohibit xAI from doing business within the UK. This will likely cause them to leave this market anyway, but that is on their own volition. This ensures the slope doesn't slide further on a free and open internet since we are making it clear that we respect the internet for what it should be: a free and open resource for everyone to use. Legal consequences should be arranged for users who violate laws and servers that host any content that does. The technical infrastructure of the internet should not be impacted to handle this.

The reaction from the right has been to attack the government on "free speech" grounds. To be clear, the government has harmed free speech in a number of ways with recent protest crackdowns, but this isn't one. This block is over Grok's image generation. If they stopped that, I guarantee the tune would change. I want the government to go for a "no business" approach, but it is obvious why they are doing this now.

Twitter isn't a free speech platform. Anyone that tries to justify it with that are being intellectually dishonest. I dare you to go to Twitter right now and type something about "cis women". Your post will be hidden at best, and you will be banned at worst. The only reason Elon hasn't purged all left wing accounts yet is he wants to keep the vague idea it allows all points of view open.

## I will keep a presence (but many of you probably shouldn't)

Even with all of this, I will keep a presence with a VPN if it gets blocked. This is for a few reasons:

- Tech Twitter is still thriving. It is where most TypeScript conversations happen, and until that changes, my presence there is needed.
- Being transgender, I can offer a perspective on things that not many on the platform can. Therefore, I feel like having my speech there is extra valuable.
- I need it for work since I deal with American companies a lot.

It is a needed evil for me. Realistically, many others will also access it with a VPN. I get why government ministers who don't understand internet infrastructure think a block is a good idea, and I sympathise with how evil the platform can get, but the more I think about it, the more I cannot shake my hardline stance on internet infrastructure.

I get it, I really do, and I really want Grok blocked in the UK. I don't think xAI should be allowed to do business in the UK. I don't think we need to do deep packet inspection level blocks for this.
