title: "I can't support Rails and Kamal anymore"
description: "After the BDFL's recent attacks on transgender people and immigrants, I don't believe there is a good environment for contributions."

It is very unfortunate I feel I have to make this blog post. In my opinion, [DHH's](https://x.com/dhh/status/1890802527936930231) [recent](https://x.com/dhh/status/1891073751988539607) [comments](https://x.com/dhh/status/1891056652134097194) [and](https://x.com/dhh/status/1891094927003525488) [dogwhistles](https://x.com/dhh/status/1890857600264081722) have made a group of people already villanised by many people in society feel even more unwelcome.

DHH helped pioneer the modern web with Rails, and honestly, some patterns he pioneered are still in my opinion unmatched in other frameworks. With that said, his recent actions make me and many people like me feel unwelcome in the Rails community, and therefore people just won't contribute to the framework. It is hard to assume good faith when a person doesn't care about your existence.

Whilst I didn't write lines of code inside the Rails repository, I have wrote code for large Rails codebases in 2 workplaces, advocated for patches to make Rails work better on some providers, deployed many tools using Kamal and Rails (most online to this day), and have documented how to make services work with Rails even when it feels complex to use.

## The reality of being trans in the UK

People on the right wing like to portray being transgender as a process where you wake up one day, go to the doctors, and they give you hormones. This couldn't be further from the truth.

Firstly, figuring out you are transgender is a long process full of self-doubt. This is additionally fuelled by the hatred towards transgender people in many countries including the UK. Most people presume they are a number of things before they even consider that they might be transgender.

But okay, you figure out you are transgender (massively simplifying years of self-exploration and research), what then? A lot of transgender people hate their bodies and wish to prevent their bodies from changing. This is why if they are under 18, they will often go on hormone blockers, a recognised medical procedure in many countries, formerly including the UK.

The way this used to work is:

1. You'd go to your doctors and say you are transgender.
2. They wouldn't really believe you (depending on the GP) and would refer you to a GIC, primarily Travistock. This had wild wait times of 10-30 years.
3. Some GP's would (primarily with a secondary private health provider such as GenderGP) give you puberty blockers (if under 18) and hormones (if over 18). [**Puberty blockers are reversible.**](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-06/gender-affirming-care-still-safe-effective-and-reversible-review/104322428)

Un-ideal for sure, and had a kill count for people that knew their identity but didn't think they would be able to live their proper lives. However, a review happened in the UK called the Cass Review. It was wildly panned as a corrupt review, with Cass being given a peerage in the house of lords afterwards by the Conservative party.

The end result of this review was 3 major things thus far:

1. The childrens side of Travistock was closed down. This meant that GP's had nowhere to refer people to, and put children who needed it in limbo.
2. Puberty blockers were banned by the NHS.
3. There is plans to do a review on adult services (likely as corrupt and losing more people the healthcare they need), and GP's keep revoking hormones from people that need them.

In [DHH's recent blog post](https://world.hey.com/dhh/europeans-don-t-have-or-understand-free-speech-c7c406e8), he championed this change. In reality, this is just causing harm to people that urgently need healthcare now they have figured out their identity. I also object to how he raised this by saying "men who said they were women" and then linking to the self-ID page. People that champion these views genuinely cause people to be hurt. [Brianna Ghey was murdered due to her identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Brianna_Ghey) (after which, there was widespread condemnation after the former UK prime minister attacked transgender people in the commons whilst her parents were in the chamber), [a transgender woman was stabbed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93l8g35x98o), and hate is rife on the streets here. Personally, I have been beaten up twice (to which the Police were useless).

This isn't politics, this is actively causing harm to people, and I can't stand by and watch this.

## The state of the US

In this same blog post, DHH applauds JD Vance's views. It likely doesn't need saying, but Trump's first month as president has included [trying to revoke transgender people's passports](https://www.vox.com/politics/399502/transgender-passports-lgbtq-trump-marco-rubio-travel-gender), and of course, [trying to remove articles from PubMed](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00374-y). Nothing screams free speech like banning articles from a scientific journal.

Transgender people in the US are at huge risk right now. The institution is cracking down on them, banning them from serving in the military, and banning them from using the bathroom that matches their identity. Many US companies are submitting to the hate mob that is now forming within America (by the way, if you're American or British, consider Costco! They are the only major US company that has not submitted to the hate mob). The biggest risk to anyone is revoking healthcare from those who need it, and America is doing this now more so than ever.

Undocumented migrants are at huge risk too. These people power a lot of the US economy, and yet ICE are actively deporting them. Rather than looking at the exploitative managers that are misusing these people, they are just treating them as sub-human. "Just ship them off to another country" is the attitude of the current administration, and it is abhorrent.

It is wild to think that at this time of pure hatred, the previously once accepting tech community is now full of people being extremely bigoted. This isn't free speech, this is pure hatred. Supporting these views is problematic from the leadership of a supposedly inclusive project.

## His views on immigration

DHH regularly posts on the internet about "empathy suicide" and how countries shouldn't accept migrants from places that don't integrate well (to which he tends to point to pre-dominantly muslim countries). He will constantly post about non-integrating immigrants, whilst ignoring the problems that might cause them to not integrate well. A lot of these people are often fleeing war, poverty, and persecution, and the problems they face when they get to a country like the US and the UK are vitriol from the far right. Obviously, this is going to cause people to be angry at the system.

The far-right riots in the UK are a good example of this. Last year, even though I'm not an immigrant, I actually felt unsafe during the riots. It was a really toxic time to be in the UK, and in fact I went to Sweden whilst they were happening. These dogwhistles have huge impacts on the countries they are in.

Sweden does have a gang problem, this is true. However, it is way more complex than just "stop all immigration". I think it is extroadinarly distasteful to make these comments [right after Sweden's worst mass shooting in history involving a school teaching SfI (Swedish for Immigrants)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crm71dmkjjyo). By in large, as someone who loves Sweden and has a lot of friends there (and regularly goes there, like many of the stamps in my passport are at Arlanda), it is the safest country I have the pleasure of being able to go to. I am worried that the rhetoric that has hurt the UK and US so badly will trickle into Sweden.

## How this maps to the Rails community

This maps to the Rails community since when the BDFL displays toxic behaviour, they push away contributors. However much he wants to keep Rails and his politics separate, they obviously intertwine when he is the person contributing the most features from his company. when you dehumanise people, you push them away. And its not like Linux where you can generally find other maintainers to push to. In Rails, DHH is the one to do the vast majority of the merges.

I am really disappointed with his recent stances, and I would love to live in a better, more respectful world. In my opinion, the leaders of communities in tech should be held to a higher standard due to this.

## Astro and Next are getting good, anyway

I have naturally been using both Astro and Next.js a lot more recently anyway, they have the following advantages:

- Next app router has got so much better. Rather than needing to worry about how to make an interactive frontend work nicely, I can just use a mix of server actions and client components. This is a lot easier than trying to shoehorn interactivity into Rails.
- Static site generation is a breeze compared to Rails. You don't need to worry about how to make a static site work nicely, and it is a lot more possible in a lot more circumstances than Rails.
- It is a lot faster and cleaner of a DX than Rails. It feels like Rails has stalled a bit when it comes to progress, and both Astro and Next have been moving forward with new features.

There is still plenty of work to be done here. I am personally writing a nice RPC framework with a Rails inspired CLI (it will support exporting Ruby soon). But Rails also needs plenty of work as far as TS interop goes, and I'd wager on the former being a better bet.
