This is a followup email to the reply I got after [this email](https://astrid.place/blog/nhs-sussex). You can see the original reply from them [here](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ij5756nvubeeqo2kn6eeezdx/post/3lz25gygugk23).

To whom this may concern,

I am not satisfied with this complaint response and wish to escalate it up the chain. Here are my main points of contention. I'm going to go over all of my complaints line by line (other than the thank you line obviously).

> The Terms of Reference along with the fact sheet describe the rationale and potential outcomes in undertaking the safety investigation which we hope address your specific concerns.

They do not. The idea that you go after a GP for ensuring healthcare to people that need it the most is sickening. The anxiety that this causes to others in this community and how it could escalate, the violence caused by people taking this and using it as a weapon - it all cannot be calculated. You say you are going to refer young people onto other services, but:

- This concerns me because what if the scope gets expanded to people my age (I'm 23 for context)

- These people have to go into the same referral pool as I am in. It's a shirking of responsibiltiy from someone who was happily providing the service to a waiting queue. Make no mistake, there is a high likelihood will die over this. Your own risk analysis kmows this is a risk, and you can't just shrug that off because "well they are in the other queue now". The harm is unquantifiable.

- As you haven't done anywhere in this complaint, you don't actually respond to how messed up the A/B testing of GIC care is, it makes me wonder if the email was even read to be honest!

> In particular we would reiterate the recognition of the need to support these young people with any proposed change in their treatment pathway with timely support from the Mental Health services, Endocrinologists and the National Gender service dependent on their specific outcome. 

This is great and all but we both know this doesn't happen. You are speaking to someone who has been on a GIC waiting list for years.

> Part of the reason in conducting the investigation is to consider further whether any harm or potential harm can be identified. 

Your idea of "harm" is healthcare. Puberty blockers are a safe medication as proven by other countries, and by taking it away, you will be harming patients potentially with grave outcomes. The biggest harm I had in my childhood was puberty in the wrong body.

> We do of course recognise the importance of trust in the NHS for the Trans Community and that there is a responsibility to ensure that patients are receiving safe treatment which follows national guidelines based on the best and most recent medical evidence.

So you do harmful A/B tests for healthcare and have super long waiting lists to harm patients? Your medical guidance is based off the likes of Sex Matters, not the reality of the situation.

The footer of "Improving lives together" when doing this is really the cherry on the cake. What part of these actions improves lives?
