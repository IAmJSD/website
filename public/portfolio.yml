  'DigitalOcean (Contractual Software Engineer)':
    started: 2019
    left: 2021
    url: https://digitalocean.com
    description: My job was to write code for the community aspects of the DigitalOcean website. DigitalOcean is a large cloud provider that powers businesses such as Slack and GitLab. My job at DigitalOcean was writing various community tools and working on the start of their Next.js platform. These tools used a variety of frameworks such as React and Vue, and also used various different API's. An example of a set of tools I maintained at DigitalOcean is their <a href="https://do-community.github.io/dns-tool/">community DNS tools</a>. For this specific set of tools, we used Vue and the Cloudflare DNS-over-HTTPS API. This made the tool very portable and easy to insert into the legacy Rails site at the time and the more modern version later down the road.

    description: MagicCap is a image/GIF/clipboard capture and file upload suite for macOS and Linux. MagicCap was created by me in mid 2018 due to the lack of good capture software on both platforms (whereas Windows has ShareX). During my time owning MagicCap, I have reviewed a lot of large changes, set up a CI so that the application can easily be built, and became extremely proficient in the Electron framework.
